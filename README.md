# GitHub Alfred extension
An simple [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension for GitHub. The purpose
of this extension was to learn how to integrate with Alfred, so there may be no
real business value in this extension.

The extension has been tested on **Ruby 1.8.7p357** and **Ruby 1.9.3p194**.

## Usage
By using the keyword `github` you active the extension and can then supply
subcommands on which the extension will respond to.

    github user <username>
    github search <search_term>
    github repository <username> <repository=username>
    
## Installation
The lastest release is always located in the *release* directory. Simply download
the extension and Alfred will handle the rest.
